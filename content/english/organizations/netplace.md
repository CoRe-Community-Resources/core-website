We organise the following activities:
- Biweekly online seminars of one hour for early-career researchers in Complex and Network Science. In the first half of the seminar, the invited speaker (usually an early-career researcher) talks about his research (including questions). In the second half of the seminar, the speaker introduces a topic of discussion, related to a problem or difficulty in academic life and other struggles in our research field (i.e. not talking about any research though)
- Seminars are registered and published on Youtube
- We write a blog where we summarize the discussion of the seminar, published on our website and on Twitter/X (also have a bluesky and mastodon account)
- Panel discussions during conferences and help running social activities in conferences (already done at NetSci2023, NetSciX2024, and NetSci2024).
- 1-day workshop in London in late 2024 to tackle specific problems in our field (not research specific)
