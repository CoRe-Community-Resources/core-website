Complexity Cat is a weekly journalistic blog, an independent and non-profit media that seeks to communicate everything related to complexity science. Complexity Cat is an initiative created and promoted by Amahury J. L. DÃ­az, a Mexican physicist who wanted to develop a communication channel where young researchers interested in complex systems (and other similar interdisciplinary fields) could keep abreast of the latest news related to them. Currently there are four other people (Ilich Silva, Daria Gomez, Carlos Tapia and Mario Kirwant) helping the main creator to review his writings and to develop infographics to share in social media. If possible, the final form of Complexity Cat will be an independent, self-managed, peer-reviewed, open-access, free-publication journal, in which reviewers are paid for their valuable work. We are open to collaborations, if you are interested in contributing to our project in any format, do not hesitate to contact us.
